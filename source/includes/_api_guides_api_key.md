# API Key

In order to interact with the Tiki API, your app must provide the necessary authentication credentials in each HTTP request.
In Tiki Seller Center (the system where sellers manage their products and orders), the API key is configured for each seller before integrating with the third party system so you must have an account in https://sellercenter.tiki.vn/, please ask your business team for this.

1. Visit Tiki Seller Center :
    - [https://sellercenter.tiki.vn/](https://sellercenter.tiki.vn/) if you want to get production api token
    - [https://sandbox-sellercenter.tiki.vn/](https://sandbox-sellercenter.tiki.vn/) if you want to get sandbox api token
2. Register new account ( if this is your first time :D )
3. Login 
4. Look at the top right corner, go to your profile setting
