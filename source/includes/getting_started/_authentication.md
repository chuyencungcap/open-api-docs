## Authentication and Authorization

There are 2 ways to authenticate and authorize against Open API:

* [Using OAuth2](#oauth2): The official way
* [Using API Key](#api-key): The legacy way

If you are using API Key to authenticate/authorize against Open API, please consider switching to using OAuth2. 
We planned to drop the use of API Key at the end of 2020, and move to OAuth2 totally.
