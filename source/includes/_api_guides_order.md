By default, you will get orders in the queueing state, queueing is state order waiting for confirmation

In addition to status queueing, we support you to query according to some of the status below:

| Status                      | Description                                | User for |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |

| seller_canceled             | Seller has canceled this order before      | Get list order seller has canceled |
| successful_delivery         | The order has been delivered successfully  | Get list order delivery successfully |
| complete                    | The order has been complete                | Get list order complete |
| all                         | Get all order                              | Get all order  |



You can query orders by the time created:

* _created_from_date_: format _yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss_, example: 2019-07-25 17:21:17
    
* _created_to_date_: format _yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss_, example: 2019-07-25 17:21:17

## Confirm an order

When customer buy your product, TIKI have to make sure this product is still available in your warehouse. That's why confirm order is necessary

### Confirm order flow
![](https://salt.tikicdn.com/ts/docs/85/1f/19/58a018ffe15e9919d9c3e8fb67c41e8c.jpg)

<div class="api-endpoint">
	<div class="endpoint-data">
		<i class="label label-get">POST</i>
		<h6>https://api.tiki.vn/integration/v1/orders/confirmItems</h6>
	</div>
</div>

> Example confirm an order
 
```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/orders/confirmItems' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'tiki-api: 55f438d1-3438-409e-b5a4-9d16e764c5b8' \
--data-raw '{
  "order_code": "929231617",
  "warehouse_id": 903,
  "item_ids": [25205113],
  "delivery_commitment_time": "2019-12-03 23:59:59",
  "tracking_number": "929231617"
}'
```

If your order fulfillment_type is **tiki_delivery** congratulation, you don't need to confirm the order as we have supported automatic order confirmation with this type.

Before confirm order you need to determine which products are in stock.

_**Warehouse**_ contains information about the address, contact point about the location of products that you have registered with TIKI.

We support API [get warehouse](#api-get-warehouses) to see the list warehouse you registered before. If you don't see any match warehouse you can tell _seller support_ to add it manually.

> Warehouse response body

```json
[
    {
        "contact_email": "fhds@gmail.com",
        "contact_name": "lan",
        "contact_phone": "0989777666",
        "country": {
            "code": "vn",
            "name": "Viet Nam"
        },
        "district": {
            "code": "VN039007",
            "name": "Quận 10"
        },
        "name": "kho 3-hcm",
        "region": {
            "code": "VN039",
            "name": "Hồ Chí Minh"
        },
        "street": "cmt8",
        "ward": {
            "code": "VN039007001",
            "name": "Phường 01"
        },
        "warehouse_id": 900
    }
]
```        

From this warehouses response you need to note:

* _**warehouse_id**_: The id identifies your warehouse in the Tiki system


After customer place an order, seller have to send a [confirm order items](#api-confirm-order-items) to make sure your product is still available. 
This is a important step before delivery product to customer so please confirm it as soon as possible 

Remember the two fields that I told you to save to confirm your order. 
Please provide **_warehouse_id_** with _**order_code**_ & your list of available order item id.
You need these select item for confirm and add item to **item_ids**

**Example1**: your order has 5 items as _[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]_ but only 2 items _[1, 3]_ of them are in stock. Just add these 2 item id to the _**item_ids**_, we will implicitly assume that the other 3 _items=[2, 4, 5]_ are no longer available. Now the _item_ids=[1, 3]_


**Example2** if all of your items is not available then give us an empty _**item_ids**_ list. Now _item_ids=[]_


In addition to the **warehouse_id** and **item_ids** parameters, you need to pay extra attention:

* _delivery_commitment_time_: It is the time that you commit to deliver to customers, String datetime with format Y-m-d H:i:s.
* _tracking_number_: tracking_number is code for tracking order via 3rd party system or anything like this. If you don't know what is it, then you should edit tracking_number equal order_code

## Update delivery status


```http
POST https://api.tiki.vn/integration/{version}/orders/updateDeliveryStatus
```

> Request body

```json
{
    "order_code": "327965376-5vHl1b",
    "update_time":"2019-11-23 23:59:59",
    "status": "ready_for_delivery"
}
```


<div class="api-endpoint">
	<div class="endpoint-data">
		<i class="label label-get">POST</i>
		<h6>https://api.tiki.vn/integration/v1/orders/updateDeliveryStatus</h6>
	</div>
</div>

After confirm order, you might need to update delivery status of the order.

* If your order fulfillment type is `tiki_delivery` or `dropship` congratulation, TIKI will help you complete this order.

* If your order fulfillment type is `seller_delivery` `cross_border` you might need to update the status of the order, 
so TIKI updates the system and sends information to customers.

Go here for more details about using the [update delivery status](#api-update-delivery-status) endpoint.


## Get order's shipping label to print
```http
GET https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/orders/905205190/print
```

> Response example:

```json
{
    "shipping_label_url": "https://uat.tikicdn.com/ts/print/0d/71/f7/c68cf4ba4b29d1f79bac442a2ec2aa42.html"
}
```

<div class="api-endpoint">
	<div class="endpoint-data">
		<i class="label label-get">GET</i>
		<h6>https://api.tiki.vn/integration/v1/orders/905205190/print</h6>
	</div>
</div>

This endpoint is use when your order's fulfillment type is `seller_delivery` or `cross_border`, it use to get order's 
shipping label so you can print it.

This contains shipping information only so if your order does not fall into these two types you can simply ignore this endpoint.
Go here for more details [get order's shipping label endpoint](#api-get-order-shipping-label)

Example order's shipping label:

![](https://salt.tikicdn.com/ts/files/cf/51/bf/edb4c126a9124dbf76e6d519d4e06310.png)

In this example orders label you need note:

* **1)**: orders code
* **2)**: the mode of payment that the user has used
* **3)**: the address, phone of customer for delivery
* **4)**: total amount shipper to be collected from customer


## Test orders on sandbox

In sandbox we provide an endpoint for you to create mock orders. So you can test order management flow as it is on production.
Go here for the details of using [create mock order endpoint](#api-create-mock-order) to create mock orders for testing.

After created mock orders you can follow the same steps as described above for production environment test to order 
management flow in sandbox environment.
