# OAuth2

## Simple integration flow

### 1. Request for a client account

You need to file an issue at [Open API Docs](https://github.com/tikivn/open-api-docs/issues) to request for a client account. 
Provide us your public email and we will contact you to proceed.

### 2. Client configurations

Once you have a client account, you can start configuring your client app to interact with our OAuth2 system. 
By integrating with our OAuth2 system, your client app can ask users for their approval to manage their store on Tiki
or to access their store data.

You will need the following configs for your client app:

* **Authorization** endpoint `/sc/oauth2/auth`
* **Token** endpoint `/sc/oauth2/token`
* Host
  * **Production** `api.tiki.vn`
  * **Development** `api-sandbox.tiki.vn`
* **Client Credentials** that we provided you after the client request
* Supported flow: **Authorization Code**

### 3. Client libraries

We strongly recommend your team not to write your own code to interact with OAuth 2.0. Use open source & battle-tested libraries instead. 
These cilent libraries will interact with our OAuth2 system to obtain users' approval as well as asking for `access_token`. You then simply use 
these `access_token`s to make requests to Tiki.

It heavily depends on the libraries and frameworks, the integration will differs:

* Some libraries will only perform the authorization base on your provided configurations to obtain the `access_token`. 
And you will need to add `Authorization` header by yourself to every requests to Tiki with those `acccess_token`s. 
You will also need to manually handle token expiration and renewal (using `refresh_token`).
* Some others libraries integrate deeply the OAuth2 Standard with your Http Client. 
With above [Client Configurations](#2-client-configurations) your Http Client is ready to make requests to Tiki. You do not need to 
add `Authorization` header by yourself.

Here are some example libraries:

* NodeJS
  * [passport](http://www.passportjs.org/)
  * [simple-oauth2](https://github.com/lelylan/simple-oauth2)
* Golang
  * [golang/oauth2](https://github.com/golang/oauth2)
* PHP
  * [oauth2-client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client)
* Java
  * [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)

For a full list of client libraries go [here](https://oauth.net/code/).

### 4. Making requests from Client App

The following headers are mandatory in your requests to Tiki:

> Example headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer 4wx_Zpe_VVkZ2oka8pFSeeRt8C_...
```

* `Authorization`: The authorization with `access_token` obtained from the OAuth2.

If you still want to integrate manually with OAuth2, follow the [integration flow](#complex-integration-flow) carefully.

## Complex integration flow

At the moment we only support client type `confidential` as described in The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [#section-2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1). Therefore, in order to integrate with our Authorization Code Flow, you will need to 

* Build a *client app* with both *frontend* and *backend*
* The frontend will be in charged of requesting users' consent
* The backend will be in charged of keeping the client credentials (a.k.a client_id/client_secret pair) to request tokens from our token endpoint

### 1. Ask user to start the flow

Your frontend will ask the user (i.e. seller) to allow access to user's data in Tiki System (for your client app to manage their store).

### 2. Start the flow

If user accepts the request, `redirect` user agent (i.e. the browser) to our [/sc/oauth2/auth](/sc/oauth2/auth) endpoint

> Http request to authorization endpoint

```
GET /sc/oauth2/auth HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Host: https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/
```

* **Authentication**: `None`
* **Query components**:
  * `response_type` Must be `code`
  * `client_id` Your Client Id
  * `redirect_uri` Your registered redirection URI
  * `scope` The scope you want to request from user
  * `state` Some random string for security reason
 
> Query component example

```
?response_type=code&client_id=f8es8ejks9aed8ok&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fyour.registered.redirection.uri&scope=offline%20all&state=RJvROw5fLpM2OaTs
```

* Remember to url-encode all the query components

See [Authorization Request](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1) for more details. Right now we did not define concrete scopes, therefore we accept scope `all` along with `openid` and `offline`. 

* `all` means you are requesting access to all resources of the authorizing seller
* `all` does NOT include `openid` and `offline`
* `offline` is neccessary for your client app to obtain a `refresh_token`.

### 3. User login and allow/deny your access requests on Tiki

User will be authenticated against our system (Tiki) and be asked to grant your client app access rights. *No action required on your side*.

### 4. User agent is redirected back to your client app

After [Login & Consent](#3-user-login-and-allowdeny-your-access-requests-on-tiki) has completed, our system will redirect user agent back to the `redirect_uri` that your app specified above.

> If user allows, your system will receive these components

```
?code=wwxdZmftI2r0Xn5gbwXmd3mVjQCeWxh7RHDs5_OaNSI...&scope=offline all&state=RJvROw5fLpM2OaTs
```

* If user allows, the redirection URI has these parameters in the query component:
  * `code` parameter will be used to **request for tokens**
  * `scope` parameter contains all the **authorized scopes** for your client app
  * `state` parameter for security reason

> If user denies, your system will receive these components

```
?error=access_denied&error_code=403&error_hint=User denied the access request...
```

* If user denies, the redirection URI has these parameters in the query component:
  * `error` is the error name
  * `error_code` represents the error status code (404, 403, 401, ...).
  * `error_hint` contains further information on the nature of the error.

User agent will then send the request to your backend at `redirect_uri`. Your `backend` should be able to handle above redirection URI and recognize the query component.

### 5. Ask for tokens

> Example token request

```
POST /sc/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: application/json
Host: https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/
```

Then your `backend` will ask for tokens by performing a POST to our [/sc/oauth2/token](/sc/oauth2/token) endpoint with `x-www-form-urlencoded` body.

> Example token request authorization header for
> client_id = e5edc0e43g3zb6c3
> client_secret = xNTZVvEn5WwA_esLe_laIWlXyISGjTfO

```
Authorization: Basic ZTVlZGMwZTQzZzN6YjZjMzp4TlRaVnZFbjVXd0FfZXNMZV9sYUlXbFh5SVNHalRmTw==
```

* **Authentication**

  * Required
  * At the moment, we only support BasicAuth in request header

* **Body** - You need to send the following `required` parameters

  * `grant_type` Must be `authorization_code`
  * `code` The `code` parameter you received from the [redirection](#4-user-agent-is-redirected-back-to-your-client-app)
  * `redirect_uri` Your registered redirection URI
  * `client_id` Your Client Id

> Example token request body

```
grant_type=authorization_code&code=wwxdZmftI2r0Xn5gbwXmd3mVjQCeWxh7RHDs5_OaNSI...&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080&client_id=kiotviet
```

* **Response** - You will get the following
  * `access_token` The token for later authorization
  * `expires_in` Token time-to-live in `seconds`
  * `id_token` 
  * `refresh_token` The token to be used with `refresh_token` grant type
  * `scope` Authorized scopes (i.e. user-granted scopes)
  * `token_type`

> Example token request response

```json
{
    "access_token": "4wx_Zpe_VVkZ2oka8pFSeeRt8C_sJNIucA7oIDcsl5g.8IPUATsK2TcxmOPE4zF5OasGJerD8BEIQ...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6InB1YmxpYzpkMzJjNjIxOC00NWIwLTQ1MWQtOTRlNS1lOWFkNz...",
    "refresh_token": "IJGpF1yHr35VeKuqB81jBKOmacbgYfEjOLgHWl6q0qw.MK_3Rxo_OJWPRZ0S_Q2zGzJuxFu2vIHUE...",
    "scope": "offline all",
    "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

See [Token Endpoint](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.2) for more details.

From now your `backend` can use the `access_token` to perform BearerAuth when calling Tiki. This `access_token` is supported by the following APIs:

* Open API

Again, `refresh_token` is only returned if you requested for scope  `offline` when initiating this flow. 

### 6. Refresh token

> Example refresh token request body

```
grant_type=refresh_token
refresh_token=IJGpF1yHr35VeKuqB81jBKOmacbgYfEjOLgHWl6q0qw.MK_3Rxo_OJWPRZ0S_Q2zGzJuxFu2vIHUE...
redirect_uri=http://your.registered.redirection.uri/
client_id=your_client_id
```

When your `access_token` is expired, use the `refresh_token` to get a new one.
You  need to make a request to token endpoint. Almost the same as [Ask for tokens](#5-ask-for-tokens), except for the body.

* Replace `grant_type=code` by `grant_type=refresh_token`
* Replace `code=...` by `refresh_token=your.last-received.refresh-token`
